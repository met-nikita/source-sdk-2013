// STEAMWORKS_VERSION
//
// An integer interpretation of the version of the Steamworks SDK currently being used by this codebase
// For example:
//
// - Steamworks SDK v1.23 would be "1230"
// - Source SDK 2013 uses v1.26a by default, which is expressed as "1261"
// - As of October 8 2022, the latest version of Steamworks SDK is v1.55, which is expressed as "1550"
//
// Newer versions of Steamworks are used to integrate newer Steam features
//
$Macro STEAMWORKS_VERSION	"1261"

// STEAM_API_MOD_HACK
//
// Enables hacks intended to be used when the engine's steam_api.dll cannot be overwritten, which is the
// case for regular Source 2013 mods.
//
// On Windows, this adds a manifest to the client/server.dll which forces them to load the Steam API from
// the mod's own bin folder instead of from the Source 2013 engine bin folder.
//
// On Linux, this changes the server/client.so to call for a renamed "steam_ap2" library. Unfortunately,
// this is not currently mounted adjacent to the mod .so files and this "steam_ap2" must be placed into
// the user's Source 2013 engine bin folder next to the original library. This may change in the future.
//
// These steps are required for non-Steam mods to update the Steam API, but if you are responsible for a
// Steam mod/standalone app and can overwrite engine binaries for all users, you should just overwrite the
// original steam_api library yourself instead of using these hacks.
//
$Conditional STEAM_API_MOD_HACK	"0"

// STEAM_INPUT
// Adds Steam Input and Steam Deck integration.
$Conditional STEAM_INPUT	"1"
